# KALEIDOS-APEX-SUBJECT-1
This repository introduces an adaptive formula inspired by the CHSH logic, designed to evaluate, test, and improve model performance across multiple conditions. By adapting CHSH principles into a flexible structure, it provides a systematic way to analyze results, ensure reliability, and explore deeper insights in experimentation.

Version Apex Elite V10.21 — Proactively Adaptive, Auditable and Robust

Description

This project implements the Adaptive Deterministic EPR Formula up to version 10.21. The core novelty lies in adapting the logic of CHSH into an adaptive CHSH formulation that is directly embedded into the calibration and evaluation process. The formula is designed to remain deterministic, auditable, and resilient under shifting distributions and adversarial perturbations.

The framework is built with PyTorch 2.8.0, BoTorch, GPyTorch and NumPyro. It supports low overhead online inference as well as offline ablation, validation and synthetic adversarial evaluation.
